        I enjoy building automated workflows and applications that facilitate the creative process at organizations that are making an impact in immersive and interactive experiences, visual storytelling, or tools for scientific discovery.

          I'm currently developing 3D applications as an independent contractor. Previously, I was a Technical Artist II at <a className="text-primary" target="_blank" href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/ea-sports">Electronic Arts</a> working on artist tools in Frostbite Engine and optimizing content creation pipelines. I was also a software engineer at the startup <em>FNX Technologies</em> where I helped build a rendering-as-a-service product for leading fashion & apparel brands.
          We eventually got acquired by <a className="text-primary" target="_blank" href="https://unifi3d.co/">UNIFI3D</a> (<em>Li & Fung, Ltd</em>)
          where I continued to build automated workflows and integrated 3D collaboration solutions in their proprietary digital asset management system.
          In the previous 4+ years, I developed tools for artists and technical directors in the visual effects production pipeline in feature films
          such as <em>Black Panther</em> and <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>.

          My deep appreciation for music led me to create <em>Lyddy</em> ‚Äî a sound-sharing social networking web app aimed at uniting people through sound, allowing them to explore genres by means of hashtags.

          Other things I love include visual effects, <a className="text-primary" href="https://vimeo.com/danielvasquez" target="_blank">filmmaking</a>, sailing, hiking, and the ocean. I also had fun teaching science & math at a <a className="text-primary" href="https://www.eibparis.com/en" target="_blank">high school</a> in Paris, France.
