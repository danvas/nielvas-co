      <h1>I design & develop software tools to automate workflows in digital content creation and integrating them into web applications.</h1>
      <br></br>
      <p>In the past 5 years, I created software tools for the visual effects pipeline in feature films, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1825683/?ref_=nm_flmg_vsl_5">Black Panther</a> and Aquaman.</p>
      <p>As a web developer I created <a target="_blank" href="https://lyddy.stream/nielvas">Lyddy</a> â€” a sound-sharing social networking web application which allows users to post third-party audio sources to their stream, follow other user streams, and organize posts by hashtags.</p>
      <p>Currently I'm a Software Engineer at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fnx.tech">FNX Technologies</a>, helping to integrate 3D visualization for the product lifecycle in the Fashion and Apparel supply chain.</p>
